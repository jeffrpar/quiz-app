## Description

I was challenged to create a coding quiz web app to assist with coding interview preparation. This was to consist of multiple choice questions and track your score throughout the quiz. If you get a question wrong, it will subtract time from the timer, and if the timer reaches 0 or you answer all questions, the quiz ends and your score is displayed. You can save your score to a leaderboard, however I still have an issue where it records your score twice.
